## What is Thoughty?
Thoughty is a tool I'm developing to allow you to have a personal diary or easily organise your thoughts. For people like me who depend on others too much I wish to lower the barrier of entry.

By building a tool that allows you to write entries in the cloud, publicize them via a link or just have an easy way to lookup past writings.
## Self-hosting?
if you have the know how and want the privacy you can self-host our sync server via docker compose (Coming soon..)
