## What is Thoughty?
Thoughty is a tool I'm developing to allow you to have a personal diary or easily organise your thoughts. For people like me who depend on others too much I wish to lower the barrier or entry by building a tool that allows you to write entries in the cloud, publicize them via a link or just have an easy way to lookup past writings.
## Am I able to build modified clients, mobile apps, etc?
Of course! The api is fully open source and I'm developing documentation for it as well
## Can I trust you with this data?
I host a public instance that I use myself where I have full control over the physical hardware so no other entity could be reading your data and of course I promise via my privacy policy to never read, copy or modify any data you upload to my service.

Understandably if you have the know how and want the privacy you can self- host our sync server via docker compose (Includes an express web server and mongodb database, docker allows it to run on almost any linux distro).
