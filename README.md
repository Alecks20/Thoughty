## What is Thoughty?
Thoughty is a tool I'm developing to allow you to have a personal diary or easily organise your thoughts. For people like me who depend on others too much I wish to lower the barrier or entry by building a tool that allows you to write entries in the cloud, publicize them via a link or just have an easy way to lookup past writings.
## Am I locked in to using this GUI?
Absoluely not, all this does is use the api on thoughty-sync, public api docuemntation is being worked on.
## Can I trust you with this data?
I do host a public instance that I use myself where I have full control over the physical hardware so no other entity could be reading your data and of couse I promise via my privacy policy to never read, copy or modify any data you upload to my service.

Understandably if you have the know how and want the privacy you can self host your own open-source sync server via docker compose.
